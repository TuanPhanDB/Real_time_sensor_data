Real-time Sensor Data

This is a project that simulates the IoT project to control the temperature and humidity for the services like plant-house, stock storage, smart house, ...

This project provides scripts for simulating real-time sensor data and streaming by Kafka services. The raw stream data is stored in Cassandra and aggregated data in PostgreSQL. Grafana is used for visualizing streaming data and showing threshold that help observe and make action to control the temperature and humidity.
